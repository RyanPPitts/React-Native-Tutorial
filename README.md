# ReactNativeTutorial

First step into learning the basics of React Native.

For some reason I had a difficult time getting Xcode to work properly. In the end I had to delete previous installed node modules and package.json lock file and restart with the command line "yarn install".

To run the application you have to follow 2 steps :
1.) Run "yarn react-native start" - this will start the Metro Bundler
2.) Run "yarn raect-native run-ios" - this will run the app.js information in the Xcode iPhone simulator.
